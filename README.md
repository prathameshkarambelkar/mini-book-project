# Mini Book Project
Referred [Full React Course 2020](https://youtu.be/4UZrsTqkcW4) from freecodecamp to clear my fundamentals about props in reactjs.
Props is just shorter form for properties in react, it is used to pass data from one component to another.
There are two ways to use props, one => simply pass props as an argument in the function, second => destructuring props.

This project is deployed on github, you can visit it from here [link](https://prathameshkarambelkar.github.io/mini-book-project/)
